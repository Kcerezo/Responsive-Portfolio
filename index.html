                  <p>My name is Keren Cerezo and I am originally from Texas. I moved to Charlotte back in 2012 and absolutely love it here. 
                      I love that I am not a far drive from the mountains and the beach and that the city is not to big nor to small. Just the right size to get around at a good time.</p>
